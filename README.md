# tas
This is the repository for our Server-Oriented Technology class.
The task was to create a full web-application with mobile app.
This is something similar to RottenTomatoes but with video games. We implemented things like:
- registering users
- user profiles
- review system
- various rankings

### How to run:
 1. Get Docker.
 2. Clone repo.
 3. In the main folder start terminal (or PowerShell) and type `docker-compose up`
 4. Now just run `http://localhost:8000/tas/` and enjoy.
 5. When you want to finish, Ctrl-C the terminal. You might also want to type `docker-compose down`.
